// In-memory, per-process sliding-window rate limiter for the BFF auth route
// handlers (P12.S2). Ported verbatim from hi2vi_web via vocky (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`,
// including its cross-window prune fix). This is the DELIBERATELY WEAK first
// layer of abuse control:
//
//   - It is a module-level `Map`, so it RESETS on every process restart/redeploy
//     and is PER-PROCESS only (each worker / instance has its own window — it does
//     not coordinate across processes or machines).
//   - The real, robust limit is nginx `limit_req` at the edge (a P14 deploy
//     concern); the client-supplied IP (`x-forwarded-for`) is spoofable, so this
//     layer only blunts naive credential-stuffing / signup flooding.
//
// To avoid an unbounded-memory leak, every call prunes timestamps (and then empty
// keys) that have fallen outside the window before it decides. Each bucket stores
// ITS OWN `windowMs`, and the opportunistic global prune judges every OTHER bucket
// against THAT bucket's window — not the caller's — so a short-window caller can
// never prematurely evict a still-live long-window bucket.

// P12.S2 — root redirect. `/` is a pure router: a signed-in visitor goes to the
// dashboard, everyone else to login. (P14 replaces this with the public landing
// page, at which point this bounce moves behind the landing's CTA.)
//
// This replaces S1's design-system preview, which was that slice's smoke test and
// has served its purpose — the primitives are now exercised by the real auth and
// shell surfaces. The `design/canvas/` mirror remains the design-gate artifact.
//
// The check is the CHEAP one (`getSession` — cookie crypto + expiry only, no
// knowledge call): a crypto-valid-but-revoked cookie lands on /dashboard, whose
// guard 401s and returns the visitor to /login, which then renders the form rather
// than bouncing back (see `redirectIfAuthenticated`). Reading the cookie makes `/`
// dynamic, so it is never prerendered.

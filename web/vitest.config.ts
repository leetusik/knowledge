/**
 * Vitest config (P12.S2) — deliberately minimal; the only two entries that carry
 * weight are the aliases:
 *
 *   `@`           — mirrors tsconfig's `@/*` → `./src` path mapping.
 *   `server-only` — the real package THROWS on import outside a React Server
 *                   Component graph (that is its entire job). The modules under
 *                   test are server-only by design, so tests alias it to an inert
 *                   stub. This only affects the test run: `next build` still
 *                   resolves the real package, so the guarantee that no client
 *                   bundle can import the session key remains enforced.
 *
 * Tests are Node-environment (no jsdom): everything under test is server-side
 * crypto, route handlers, and guards.

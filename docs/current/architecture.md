# Architecture

## Status

New Project is newly bootstrapped. This document should describe stable system-level truth as the app takes shape.

## Current Repo Shape

- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`: equivalent compact routing contracts
- `docs/current/`: generated latest doc snapshots
- `docs/versions/`: immutable durable doc versions by category
- `docs/index.json`: latest-version map
- `works/state.json`: current/next pointer
- `works/index.json`: generated machine index
- `works/backlog.md`: generated human dashboard
- `works/phases/active/`: active phase folders
- `works/phases/archived/`: archived phase folders
- `works/deferred/`: deferred job folders
- `scripts/workflow.py`: workflow and docs version manager
- `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`: tool entry points (skills, subagents, config)

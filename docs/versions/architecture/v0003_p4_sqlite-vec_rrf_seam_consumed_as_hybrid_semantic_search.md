summary: P4: sqlite-vec/RRF seam consumed as hybrid semantic search

# Architecture

## Status

Both tracks are implemented (Track 2 the DB-backed document API, Track 1 public GitHub Pages publishing). This doc records the stable system shape. As of P4 the previously-documented `sqlite-vec`/RRF extension seam is **consumed**: hybrid semantic search is live, reusing changple5's Gemini embedding setup, with the single-worker invariant untouched.

## System Shape

Two containers run side by side over **one** bind-mounted repo:

- **`kb`** — the MkDocs Material viewer (host 8765, repo mounted at `/docs`), auto-nav from the `docs/` tree.
- **`api`** — the FastAPI read/write document service (host 8766, repo mounted at `/repo`), single uvicorn worker.
- **Persistence**: `docs/` markdown is the **canonical** store; SQLite (`data/kb.sqlite3`, FTS5, WAL) is a **disposable projection** rebuilt from files by reindex.

The shared bind mount is what lets a write on the API (8766) live-reload on the viewer site (8765) within ~1s.

## API-Owns-Writes Flow

A single `POST /api/documents`, under one in-process write lock:

1. validate the convention inputs;
2. write `docs/<project>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` with byte-exact frontmatter;
3. insert the Recent bullet in `docs/index.md` (marker → `## Recent` heading → append ladder);
4. upsert the DB row;
5. make a **scoped** git commit — `git add` only the two touched paths (**never `-A`**), **never push**.

A failed commit **never rolls back** the file/DB (`committed:false`); `docs/` stays canonical and `POST /api/reindex` reconciles any drift (manual edits, API-down fallback writes, git resets).

## Boundaries / Constraints

- **Single-writer**: one uvicorn worker + one in-process lock — never scale workers (WAL gives read concurrency).
- **Auto-nav preserved**: `mkdocs.yml` has no `nav:` / `strict:` key; the viewer builds its sidebar from the `docs/` tree.
- **Optional bearer auth** on mutating endpoints only (`KB_API_TOKEN`).
- **This repo never edits the `bootstrap_agentic_workspace` repo.**

## Extension Points

- **Hybrid semantic search (delivered P4):** the `sqlite-vec`/RRF seam in `server/search.py` is now consumed. Embeddings come from Gemini (`server/embeddings.py`, reusing changple5's `google-genai` convention), are cached by content hash in a plain `document_embeddings` BLOB table (the local venv Python can't load SQLite extensions), and a Python cosine ordering is fused with keyword ranking via RRF. The seam stays **upgrade-ready** — vectors are keyed by `doc_id`, so adopting `sqlite-vec` later touches only `db.py` + `search.py`'s cosine loop; the fusion, signals, and `mode` logic are unaffected. Embeds happen in-request (best-effort, outside the write lock) or at reindex — no background workers, so the single-worker invariant holds. With no key, search degrades gracefully to BM25-only.
- A future personal web UI built on the read API (the P4 aggregations `GET /api/tags`/`GET /api/projects` and `related` cross-links are groundwork for it and the P6 knowledge graph).
- **SaaS-someday** is noted and the architecture is kept from precluding it (out of scope for now).

## Roadmap

- **P3 — Track 1 (GitHub Pages publishing)**: the remaining track; deploys stay on the operator's manual `git push`.
- **`/explain` consumer**: the `/explain` skill (in `bootstrap_agentic_workspace`) becomes the API's client, POSTing documents instead of writing files — delivered via a prepared handover prompt in that other repo (operator action, never edited from here).

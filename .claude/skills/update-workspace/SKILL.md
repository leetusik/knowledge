# update-workspace

Update the CURRENT repo's agentic-workspace machinery to the latest upstream cornerstone, preserving your own work. Explicit-invocation only. Run this when the cornerstone has changed since you adopted or last synced and you want this repo to match the current version. (For first-time adoption use `/retrofit` instead.)

What it changes: it OVERWRITES machinery (`scripts/workflow.py`, the `.claude/agents/` subagents, every skill under `.claude/skills/`, `works/templates/*`), additively MERGES `.claude/settings.json` (removing only hooks the workspace itself retired, such as v60's `compact-gate`, and moving an `autoCompactWindow` still at a value it shipped; each listed on a `removed:` / `changed:` line), and refreshes the `CLAUDE.md` contract. It PRESERVES everything under `works/` except templates (your state, phases, slices, deferred jobs) and all of `docs/` (your versioned docs). It never commits.

**Nested personal install.** If `workflow/.agentic-nested.json` exists under the current directory, this is a private (nested) install, the default layout since v50: the engine and state live in the nested git repo `workflow/`, and the skills and agents sit untracked in the host's `.claude/`. Run this skill from the host root (never from inside `workflow/`). Every step below applies, and the steps marked **(nested)** differ. Instead of merging `.claude/settings.json` and refreshing `CLAUDE.md`, a nested update merges `.claude/settings.local.json`, refreshes `workflow/CLAUDE.workspace.md` and the managed block in `CLAUDE.local.md`, and never touches a tracked file. **The installer detects the layout itself**, so steps 5 and 7 run the same plain `--update` command for a nested and an at-root install, with no `--nested` or `--at-root`; it refuses, writing nothing, when it finds both layouts at once or when a flag contradicts the one it found. (A downstream still carrying the v49 text of this skill can keep running `--update --nested`: it matches a nested install and works.)

Preflight (read-only):

1. Confirm a git repo: `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`. If the working tree is dirty (`git status --porcelain` is non-empty), tell the operator and recommend committing or stashing first, so the update lands as a clean, reviewable diff. **(nested)** The update writes only inside `workflow/` and to untracked host files, so check `git -C workflow status --porcelain` instead, and leave the host's own branch and changes alone.
2. Confirm this repo already has the workspace: `works/state.json` (or any `works/phases/active/*/phase.json`) AND `scripts/workflow.py` must exist (**nested:** and `workflow/.agentic-nested.json`). If not, STOP — this repo has not adopted the workspace; use `/retrofit` instead.
3. If `works/.workspace-version.json` exists, read it and report the last-synced commit and time so the operator knows the starting point. Also read its `workspace_version` — the integer version this repo is on (call it **N**). If that key is absent, this repo is **pre-versioning** (adopted before workspace versions existed); note that and treat N as "pre-versioning" in the preview below.

Fetch upstream:

4. Shallow-clone the cornerstone to a temp dir and capture its HEAD commit:

   ```sh
   tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/leetusik/bootstrap_agentic_workspace.sh.git "$tmp"
   ref="$(git -C "$tmp" rev-parse HEAD)"
   ```

   The clone is a full checkout, so read the upstream version straight from it: the top `## v<M>` heading in `$tmp/CHANGELOG.md` is the **upstream version M**, and the entries under each `## v` describe what that version brings.

Preview the diff (this is the "check what is different" step):

5. First report the version gap, then show the file change-list.

   **Version gap** — compare your local version **N** (from step 3) with the upstream version **M** (the top `## v<M>` in `$tmp/CHANGELOG.md`):
   - N < M: report "workspace vN → upstream vM" and print every `## v` entry in `$tmp/CHANGELOG.md` newer than N (vN+1 … vM) — that is exactly what this sync brings, including any **Migration notes**.
   - Pre-versioning (no local `workspace_version`): say the repo is pre-versioning, then show the upstream `## v` entries and point the operator to `$tmp/CHANGELOG.md` for the full file.
   - N == M: say "already on vM; any file diff below is unreleased upstream drift".

   **File change-list** — run the freshly-cloned installer in dry-run update mode from the repo root; it writes nothing and prints the change-list:

   ```sh
   sh "$tmp/bootstrap_agentic_workspace.sh" . --update --dry-run
   ```

   **(nested)** The same command, run from the host root, detects the nested install (its banner says `(nested, detected)`); it also lists the untracked host files it would change and the clash renames it keeps.

   Show the operator the change-list: machinery files that would be updated (with +added/-removed counts) or added, settings merged, how many files are preserved and unchanged, and the update report below it, every line of it: the `removed:` / `changed:` settings lines, the files listed `stale (ours, unchanged — remove these files)`, the files listed `yours, kept`, and any `intents naming a retired mechanism`.

6. STOP and let the operator review and approve. Do not apply without approval.

Apply (after the operator approves):

7. Run the same installer in update mode, recording the upstream commit so provenance is tracked (this also stamps the upstream `workspace_version` M into `works/.workspace-version.json`):

   ```sh
   SYNCED_COMMIT="$ref" sh "$tmp/bootstrap_agentic_workspace.sh" . --update
   ```

   **(nested)** The same command, run from the host root; the installer detects the layout.

Verify:

8. The installer's update already ran `validate` / `rebuild` (or `next` for a repo without the docs subsystem) and printed the result. It preserves the repo-root `executors.toml` but refreshes the generated `slice-executor-*` agent files from upstream, so **always** run `python3 scripts/workflow.py sync-agents` after an update to re-apply the preserved per-row overrides. Then run `python3 scripts/workflow.py next` to confirm the current state under the refreshed engine. **Coming from a pre-v23 workspace:** the `low` tier is retired (routing is two-tier now — `risk: low` goes to `slice-executor-mid`, everything else to `slice-executor-high`). The update lists `.claude/agents/slice-executor-low.md` as stale when it still holds what v22 shipped, or as yours, kept when it differs (a `sync-agents` model line counts), and never deletes it; drop any `[claude.low]` block from `executors.toml` — `sync-agents` now rejects that section. **Coming from a pre-v31 workspace:** this workspace ships Claude Code only. The update checks every file under `.agents/` and `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.workspace.md` by content: what v30 shipped there, unchanged, is listed stale; anything else (your own skills in `.agents/skills/`, an `AGENTS.md` your project maintains for other tools) is listed yours, kept, and nothing here writes those paths any more. A leftover `[codex.*]` table in `executors.toml` is a hard error: `executors.toml line <n>: Codex support was removed in workspace v31 — this workspace ships Claude Code only, so drop this section`. **Coming from a pre-v32 workspace:** phases you already have carry no `acceptance` block, so they stay legacy and pass exactly as before; opt a **live** phase into the new operator acceptance gate with `python3 scripts/workflow.py accept-gate <P> --require` (never a `done` one — `validate` would then report it as done with an uncleared gate). `--update` never touches `docs/`, so the seeded `## Operator Runtime` manifest and the rewritten `## Regression Checklist` (the product's cumulative smoke list, re-run by every later phase inside its own boundary — `phase-scope <P>` names the changed files — and whole only by an operator-created QA phase, since v41) reach fresh installs only: add both to your own operations/qa docs with `doc-new-version` — copying the seed text from `installer/payloads/doc_bodies/` in the upstream clone — and fill the manifest in, or the first slice claiming real-browser verification will stop `pending` asking you for it. **Coming from a pre-v42 workspace:** a phase runs on the current checkout, exactly as it always did; the per-phase git worktree (`.claude/worktrees/P<N>-<slug>`, branch `phase/P<N>-<slug>`) is opt-in, reached by asking for it — `worktree` on `/do-next-slice` / `/do-whole-phase`, or `python3 scripts/workflow.py parallel-start <P>` by hand. `.git/info/exclude` gains `.claude/worktrees/` on the first `parallel-start` — nothing to do by hand, and `.gitignore` is untouched. Integration merges locally by default (`git merge --no-ff` after `parallel-gate`); push → PR → CI is the remote variant, and the seeded CI `parallel-gate` job still runs on `phase/*` PRs if you use it. Nothing else to run. **Coming from a v42 workspace:** the default reversed — v42 put every phase in its own worktree at first execution, v43 puts it back on the current checkout unless you ask. Two commands retired into no-ops that write nothing: `parallel-skip <P>` and `new-phase --on-main` (there is nothing left to pin, so a docs phase needs neither). Phases already stamped `execution: {"mode": "parallel"}` keep running in their worktrees and integrate unchanged; phases carrying v42's `execution: {"mode": "default"}` pin keep it and still validate — `parallel-start` refuses them rather than override a deliberate pin, so delete that block from `phase.json` by hand if you later want one in a worktree. Nothing else to run.

Report and clean up:

9. Act on the update report, then summarize. Remove **only the files listed as stale**, each by its path, never a directory wholesale; remove a directory (`rmdir`) only once its listed files are gone and it is empty. Files listed `yours, kept` stay. Each `intents naming a retired mechanism` line goes to the operator to re-confirm that phase's intent; never edit an `intent.md` yourself. Then list back to the operator every file you removed and every `removed:` / `changed:` settings line, summarize what was updated / added / merged / preserved, and show `git status`. **(nested)** Show `git -C workflow status` for the refresh to commit, and `git status --porcelain` in the host, which the update must leave as it was. Do NOT commit automatically — the operator reviews the diff and tells you when to commit. Remove the temp clone: `rm -rf "$tmp"`.

## Objective

__OBJECTIVE__

## Slices

<!-- slices:begin -->
_Generated by `python3 scripts/workflow.py rebuild` from each slice's `slice.json`; never hand-edit this block._
<!-- slices:end -->

## Decisions

_Durable cross-slice decisions. Replace a superseded line; never stack versions._

## Doc impact

_One line per durable-truth change: `- <doc>.md: <what changed> (<slice>)`. Append only; the review verifies this list and a later docs phase consolidates it into versions — never per slice, never at the review — a branch review adds its two gate sections here tagged `(gate section — written at merge)`._

## Operator Questions

_Questions only the operator can answer. Append only; every entry is routed at the review — folded into the acceptance walkthrough or filed with `defer-job`. An unrouted entry is a review finding._

## Notes for later slices

_Gotchas and constraints the next slices need, each tagged `(from P<N>.Sk)`. A slice that consumes a note removes it; the detail stays in that slice's `result.md`._

## Now

_≤ 15 lines, rewritten by every slice at its end: what is done, what the next slice must know, what is open. Last on purpose._
